## Biconomy SDK - Smart Contract Wallet Account creation 

Now that you have done the environment setup, we'll now create smart contract accounts for the Gasless minting of NFT  

This repository serves as part of the quickstart guide for the Biconomy SDK and Node.js guides. It includes a sample script that shows how to set up Biconomy for gasless transactions. The script uses the Biconomy Bundler, Smart Account, and Paymaster. 

The primary goal of this example is to help you set up the essential components and create a Biconomy Smart Account for executing transactions on the **Polygon Mumbai network.**
